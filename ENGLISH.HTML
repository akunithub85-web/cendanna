 <h1>Ecoprint project on mug</h1>
<p>Waste is the residue or discarded waste from a production process that serves no purpose and negatively impacts the environment. However, many types of waste can still be used. One example is leaves, which are quite difficult to decompose. This time, I'm writing and presenting a text about my observations of organic leaf waste.
</p>

<p><strong>Ecoprint</strong><mark>is a printing technique on certain objects, <strong>ecoprint</strong> also utilizes organic waste such as leaves and flowers, usually the way to transfer colors and shapes to <em>mugs</em> must apply heat pressure, so that the leaf pigments move to the object or <em>mug</em> provided. Usually the leaves that can be used are teak tree leaves.</p></mark> 

<p><strong>Ecoprint</strong> it provides high economic artistic value and can be a means of environmental education. Ecoprinting on mugs also teaches people to be more environmentally friendly by reducing the use of harmful synthetic dyes. Ecoprinting also supports a sustainable lifestyle by inspiring people to love the environment by choosing eco-friendly products. It also produces unique motifs and can be an economically viable business opportunity.

<p><strong>Making</strong> ecoprints on mugs is also useful for adding aesthetic value and uniqueness to everyday objects. Ecoprinting also utilizes environmentally friendly natural materials. With ecoprinting, mugs not only function as drinking vessels, but can also be decorations/artistic gifts.</p>
